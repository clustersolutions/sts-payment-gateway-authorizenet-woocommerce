= About Authorize.net =


Authorize.Net was founded in 1996, in Utah, by Jeff Knowles. Its primary market is small- to medium-sized businesses. As of 2004 it had about 90,000 customers.

Authorize.Net was one of several companies acquired by Go2Net, a company backed by Microsoft founder Paul Allen, in 1999, for US$90.5 million in cash and stock.Go2Net was acquired by InfoSpace in 2000 for about US$4 billion; Authorize.Net was acquired by Lightbridge in 2004 for US$82 million and then by CyberSource in 2007.

CyberSource was acquired by Visa Inc. in 2010 for US$2 billion. Visa has maintained Authorize.Net and Cybersource as separate services, with the Authorize.Net focusing on small- to medium-sized businesses, and Cybersource on international and large-scale payment processing. At the time of the 2010 acquisition, the company's CEO identified three priorities: expanding the ecommerce market, enhancing fraud detection and prevention, and improving data security.As of 2014, along with parent CyberSource, it had about 450,000 customers. Also in 2010, an interview Authorize.Net executive John Hammond was featured in an interview on fraud prevention.

Connecting a website to the payment processing networks is exceptionally difficult and typically beyond the expertise and technical resources of most online merchants. Instead, merchants can easily connect to the Authorize.Net Payment Gateway, which provides the complex infrastructure and security necessary to ensure fast, reliable and secure transmission of transaction data. Authorize.Net manages the routing of transactions just like a traditional credit card swipe machine you find in the physical retail world, however, Authorize.Net uses the Internet instead of a phone line. See our credit card processing diagram.

The Authorize.Net Payment Gateway is available 24/7 for processing transactions. They also offer a number of value-adding services to assist merchants in managing their businesses and protecting themselves from fraud. Additionally, the free, Authorize.Net Verified Merchant Seal can be added to a merchant's website to help build consumer confidence.

For developers, it provides an application programming interface (API) and software development kits for Android and iOS. Its Virtual Terminal and Invoice features can process manual payments. It also offers recurring billing and a plugin for the integration with Authorize.Net, and technical support is available for merchants.

Authorize.Net has the most customers of any payment processor, and has been described as one of the more senior players in the payment processing industry, retaining a "decent portion" of the industry's market share.

= How Credit Card Processing Works with Authorize.net =

Step 1: The customer submits his credit card for payment.
Step 2: Authorize.Net manages the complex routing of the data on behalf of the merchant through the following steps/entities.
Step 3: Authorize.Net passes the secure transaction information via a secure connection to the Processor. The Merchant Bank's Processor submits the transaction to the credit card network (like Visa or MasterCard). The credit card network routes the transaction to the bank that issued the credit card to the customer.
Step 4: The issuing bank approves or declines the transaction based on the customer's available funds and passes the transaction results back to the credit card network. The credit card network relays the transaction results to the merchant bank's processor. The processor relays the transaction results to Authorize.Net.
Step 5: Authorize.Net stores the transaction results and sends them to the website for the customer and merchant to see.
Step 6: The merchant delivers goods or services to the buyer.
Step 7: The issuing bank sends the appropriate funds for the transaction to the credit card network, which passes the funds to the merchant's bank. The bank then deposits the funds into the merchant's bank account. This is called 'settlement', and typically the transaction funds are deposited into the merchant's primary bank account within two to four business days.

Authorize.Net allows you to choose between its merchant account + payment gateway plan or its Payment Gateway only  plan.
